## Description
This project is based on a Codecademy.com Python exercise. As the Data Analyst at Carly's Clippers, your task is to analyze data collected over the past few weeks. By calculating key metrics, you'll help Carly plan the business operations for the upcoming month.

### Provided Data
You have been provided with three lists:

- **hairstyles**: Names of the hairstyles offered.
- **prices**: Prices corresponding to each hairstyle.
- **last_week**: Number of purchases for each hairstyle type in the past week.
Each index in **hairstyles** aligns with the corresponding index in **prices** and **last_week**. For example, the "bouffant" hairstyle has a price of 30 from the **prices** list and was purchased 2 times last week, as shown in the **last_week** list. These elements are all located at the first index of their respective lists.
